PTSD Journal
============

'Description': Veterans with combat related experiences often return home with issues that make it 
difficult to cope with normal daily routines. Veterans who suffer from Post Traumatic 
Stress Disorder find it really difficult to socialize and express their issues and concerns 
because they feel ashamed. This caused a spike in military death rates to reach average of 22 
veterans a day in the year 2013. Therapy is very helpful for the long-term benefit of veterans, 
and being able to vent and express emotions in a controlled environment can help deter some of
these tragedies. In this project, the goal will be to bridge and implement a venting
process by tracking written responses with pre-formulated questions which will consider
the veterans mood, concerns of the day, sleep quality measured by interger and a daily 
journal to keep record of specific triggers in veterans.

Personas
========

McAgee
-------
Drill Seargent Tom McAgee is an Army Ranger, recently recieved an Honorable Discharge and
is returning home. Drill McAgee used to be very sociable but since enduring five long 
years in a combat environment, he tends to yell at random people and treat them like 
brand new soldiers in basic training. Drill McAgee has to find a better way express himself,
better his mood and help his medical care team track his progress during this process.

McAgee Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drill Seargent Tom McAgee wants to be more involved with his PTSD Treatment, and 
needs a way to vent in an environment that is progressive in his recovery and treatment.

Medical Team
-------------
The Medical Team currently has no way of tracking incoming veterans progress, and the Centralized Unit
of PTSD is demanding for reports and updates on progress of veterans and status of veterans that have
positively transitioned from military service to civilian life succesfully. The Medical Team needs a method
of tracking progress, and also minimize the casualty rate of veterans suicide within their domain.

Medical Team Details 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Medical Team wants to be more involved in veteran patient's progress and needs a 
form of tracking the outcome of certain treatment and therapy, while providing a log of patients
concerns and scenarios which may further help future patients for faster recovery. 

Problem Scenarios:
==================

Drill McAgee
------------

Drill Seargent McAgee currently avoids all situations involving other people because he is emotionaly
disturbed, filled with anxiety, and has very little communication with family memebers. McAgee is affected
by nightmares and needs immediate medical help. Unfortunately, the medical services provided today don't track
a patient when they are discharged home. McAgee could return to his old ways if proper follow ups, a way of
tracking his mood and overall wellbeing are not emplaced. McAgee's only form of tracking grounding techniques and 
reflection is by written journal which he doesnt bring to appointments.

Medical Team
------------

The Medical Team has an enormous ammount of veterans lined up to see service providers daily. It is currently 
impossible to track the daily life progress and concerns of every military veteran. Today, there is an average 
of 22 veterans dying every day, due to mental illness and failure to adress the issues they return from war with.
The medical team needs to find a way to track the overall health, and triggers which may lead to physical harm.
There is currently no way of adressing this issues as of today.

Details
^^^^^^^

Drill McAgee will be attempting therapy for PTSD, currently there is no way to track
his overall mood over a period of time. Being able to track his overall behavior is very 
beneficial to better suit services that McAgee may need. This project will attempt to help
his Medical Services Team to keep a record of and track the mood and behavior of McAgee.
The Medical Team would like to input a series of questions that will be tailored to help
track specific issues with McAgee with a Default Question about his daily overall mood to 
be stored as an interger from 1 - 10 (Ascending by Severity) to allow for measuring over time, 
after the questioning McAgee will be allowed to input a maximum of 250 characters about details
of his concerns or incidents for that particular day.

Goals
^^^^^

The project will bridge the existing gap between patient and service provider, because
it is difficult for patients to disclose a month or weeks of issues within a period of one hour.
Likewise, it is difficult for service providers to provide better service without prior knowledge of 
the patients issues, concerns, and progress. This project attempts to serve a multiple purpose, allow the 
military veteran to vent and reflect daily on the issues, cocerns, mood, actions throught the day 
and help the medical team become more involved in the recovery or treatment of veterans. 

User Stories:
=============

Self Observation - Reflection
-----------------------------
As Drill Seargent Tom McAgee, I want to record my daily activities, and answer questions about grounding techniques
so that I can provide my medical team a better understanding of what my current mental health medical needs are.

Medical Progression Log
-----------------------
As The Medical Team, we want to record daily activites of patients, and have them answer preformulated questions about
grounding techniques so that we can monitor patient progress, suit their needs better and deter situations where
a patient may be in danger of relapsing.
